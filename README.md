This is a **C#** implementation of a priority Queue. It supports sorting by lowest priority (lower value takes priority) or highest priority (higher value takes priority).

The algorithm is **heap sorted** and uses generics to support any data type you wish. The objects to be queued must implment the **IComparable** interface. A heap sorted priority queue is a very fast implementation having linearithmic time complexity of **n log(n)**.
